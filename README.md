# Algorand Challange 
- Creating NTFs and Smart contracts

### overview
 - We deconstruct the Web2 architecture and extract three major components covering frontend APIs, backend servers, and supplementary databases. We accordingly modify these  components to enable seamless integration with blockchain engines:

- (i) a SaaS module for integrating Web2 software by providing generalized APIs
- (ii) a backend interpreter that interprets and forwards requests from Web2 to Web3
- (iii) a blockchain layer that configures self-governed policies via smart contracts as well as computes on-chain calculations through chain Software Development Kits (SDKs)
